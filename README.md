# EDI-project
There are two stages of the project first location of the car and second for tracking the route for a store.
<Br>
In the stage 1 we have two solutions: 
Solution 1: Use of open cv <br>
In this solution, we firstly capture the number plate of the car from the camera of the enterence and then for the car number we will be assigning the parking lot number and that slot will marked as occupied and when the car is going to leave the mall then an another camera mounted at the exit of the mall will capture number plate again and via number plate the slot will again be marked as vacent <br>
Solution 2: Use of ultrasonic sensor and QR<br>
In this solution, we will place ultra sonic sensor at every parking slot and via this sensor we will display the occupanci and vacancy of the parking slots and when the car is parked in the slot then it is marked ocupied with the help of ultra sonic sensor and when the QR is scanner then the slot is marked in a different colour in the app<br>
Stage 2:
Solution: AR VR 
In this solution, we will be directing the route to the shop through the camera of the phone using the app. By displaying the nearby stores in the camera of the phone the current location of the user is fetched and then the arrow on the same screen appears directing to the searched location and in case of using lift we will be providing the option to direct via lift or else display the floor number of the store on the top right corner.
